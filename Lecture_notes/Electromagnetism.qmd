## History of Electromagnetism

### 1820: Hans Christian Ørsted 

discovered that a current-carrying wire deflects a compass needle.
Hans Christian Ørsted’s discovery marked the first demonstration of a link between electricity and magnetism.  

**Implications**:  

- **Connection between electricity and magnetism**: Ørsted's work revealed that electric currents produce magnetic fields, laying the groundwork for the field of electromagnetism.  
- **Foundation for future research**: This observation inspired scientists like André-Marie Ampère, Jean-Baptiste Biot, and Félix Savart to further investigate the interactions between electric currents and magnetic forces.  

### 1820: André-Marie Ampère 

discovered that two current-carrying wires attract or repel each other.
André-Marie Ampère demonstrated that parallel current-carrying wires exert attractive or repulsive forces on each other, depending on the direction of the currents. His work led to Ampère's Law.  

**Implications**:  

- **Quantitative understanding of magnetic forces**: Ampère’s Law provided a mathematical description of the relationship between electric currents and the magnetic fields they produce.  
- **Technological impact**: This discovery underpins technologies such as electromagnets, electric motors, and transformers.  

### 1820: Jean-Baptiste Biot and Félix Savart 

formulated a law for the magnetic field produced by a current-carrying wire.
The Biot-Savart Law describes the magnetic field at a point in space as being proportional to the current and inversely proportional to the distance from the wire.  

**Implications**:  

- **Precision in magnetic field calculations**: This law remains a key tool in calculating magnetic fields for complex geometries.  
- **Applications in engineering**: It is essential for designing devices like inductors, solenoids, and magnetic field sensors.  

### 1831: Michael Faraday discovered that a changing magnetic field produces an electric field

Michael Faraday’s experiments revealed electromagnetic induction, the process by which a changing magnetic field generates an electric current.  

**Implications**:  

- **Electricity generation**: This principle is the foundation of power generation in electric generators and transformers.  
- **Electromagnetic wave theory**: Faraday’s findings were crucial for understanding how electric and magnetic fields interact dynamically.  

### 1834: Michael Faraday

discovered electromagnetic induction.
Michael Faraday formalized the concept that a time-varying magnetic field induces an electromotive force (EMF) in a conductor.  

**Implications**:  

- **Basis for modern power systems**: Electromagnetic induction is the principle behind electric power generation, including in alternators and dynamo machines.  
- **Understanding of energy transfer**: It clarified how magnetic energy can be converted into electrical energy and vice versa.  

### 1864: James Clerk Maxwell formulated the equations of electromagnetism

James Clerk Maxwell unified the concepts of electricity and magnetism into a comprehensive set of equations, showing that light itself is an electromagnetic wave.  

**Implications**:  

- **Unified field theory**: Maxwell’s equations describe how electric and magnetic fields propagate and interact, leading to the prediction of electromagnetic waves.  
- **Revolution in physics**: His work bridged classical physics and quantum theory, influencing the development of technologies like wireless communication, radar, and modern optics.
