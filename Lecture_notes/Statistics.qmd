## Basic Concepts

### Experiment with dice

Let us make an experiment with a dice. We will roll the dice 10 times and record the outcomes. The outcomes are the numbers from 1 to 6. We will record the number of times each number appears. The experiment is repeated 10 times. The results are shown in the table below.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

np.random.seed(0)
data = np.random.randint(1, 7, (10, 10))
df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=[f"Roll {i}" for i in range(1, 11)])
df
```

We can compute the average number of times each number appears in the 10 rolls.

```{python}
df.mean()
```
