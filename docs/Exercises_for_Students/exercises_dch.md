The problem is straightforward: analyze how the range of a projectile depends on its angle of projection. Yet, beneath this simplicity lies a complex and versatile framework. The equations governing projectile motion involve both linear and quadratic relationships, making them accessible yet deeply insightful.

What makes this topic particularly compelling is the number of free parameters involved in these equations, such as initial velocity, gravitational acceleration, and launch height.

## Problem 2: Investigating the Dynamics of a Damped Pendulum

#### Motivation:

The damped pendulum is a classic example of a physical system that exhibits rich and complex behavior despite its apparent simplicity. By introducing damping into the motion of a pendulum, the system transitions from simple harmonic motion to a more intricate dynamic governed by competing forces: restoring force, damping, and inertia. This system serves as a foundation for understanding a wide range of real-world phenomena, from mechanical oscillators to the motion of structures under external forces.

The presence of damping introduces new parameters, such as the damping coefficient, which significantly affect the pendulum's behavior. By varying these parameters, a diverse class of solutions can be obtained, including underdamped oscillations, overdamped decay, and critically damped responses. These behaviors not only illustrate fundamental principles of physics but also provide insights into engineering applications like vibration control and resonance.

   - Examine the transition between different damping regimes and their physical interpretations.

3. **Practical Applications:**
   - Discuss real-world scenarios where the damped pendulum model applies, such as in clock mechanisms, suspension systems, or seismographs.

4. **Implementation:**
   - Create a computational model to simulate the motion of a damped pendulum.
   - Visualize the behavior under various damping conditions and initial displacements.

#### Deliverables:

1. A detailed explanation of the general solutions for the damped pendulum.
2. Graphical representations of the motion for different damping coefficients, illustrating underdamped, overdamped, and critically damped scenarios.
3. A discussion on the limitations of the idealized model and how it could be extended to include nonlinear effects or external driving forces.

## Waves

### Problem 1


**Introduction:**

Interference of waves occurs when two or more waves overlap, resulting in a new wave pattern. On a water surface, this can lead to distinctive interference patterns, especially when waves originate from multiple sources arranged in specific geometries.

**Equation of a Single Disturbance:**

A circular wave on the water surface, emanating from a point source located at $(x_0, y_0)$, can be described by the equation:

$$
\eta(x, y, t) = \frac{A}{\sqrt{r}} \cdot \cos\left(kr - \omega t + \phi\right)
$$

where:

- $\eta(x, y, t)$ is the displacement of the water surface at point $(x, y)$ and time $t$,
- $A$ is the amplitude of the wave,
- $k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$ is the wave number, related to the wavelength $\lambda$,
- $\omega = 2\pi f$ is the angular frequency, related to the frequency $f$,
- $r = \sqrt{(x - x_0)^2 + (y - y_0)^2}$ is the distance from the source to the point $(x, y)$,
- $\phi$ is the initial phase.

**Problem Statement:**

Your task is to analyze the interference patterns formed on the water surface due to the superposition of waves emitted from point sources placed at the vertices of a chosen regular polygon.

**Steps to Follow:**

1. **Select a Regular Polygon:** Choose a regular polygon (e.g., equilateral triangle, square, regular pentagon).

2. **Position the Sources:** Place point wave sources at the vertices of the selected polygon.

3. **Wave Equations:** Write the equations describing the waves emitted from each source, considering their respective positions.

4. **Superposition of Waves:** Apply the principle of superposition by summing the wave displacements at each point on the water surface:

   $$
   \eta_{\text{sum}}(x, y, t) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \eta_i(x, y, t)
   $$

   where $N$ is the number of sources (vertices of the polygon).

5. **Analyze Interference Patterns:** Examine the resulting displacement $\eta_{\text{sum}}(x, y, t)$ as a function of position $(x, y)$ and time $t$. Identify regions of constructive interference (wave amplification) and destructive interference (wave cancellation).

6. **Visualization:** Present your findings graphically, illustrating the interference patterns for the chosen regular polygon.

**Considerations:**

- Assume all sources emit waves with the same amplitude $A$, wavelength $\lambda$, and frequency $f$.

- The waves are coherent, maintaining a constant phase difference.

- You may use simulation and visualization tools such as MATLAB, Python (with libraries like Matplotlib), or other graphical software to aid in your analysis.

**Objective:**

The goal is to understand how the geometric arrangement of wave sources influences the resulting interference patterns on the water surface.
