## Mechanics

### Problem 1

Discuss the problem of projectile motion. Investigate the dependence of the range on the angle of projection.

### Problem 2

Analyze the dynamics of a damped pendulum.


## Gravity

### Problem 1

Analyze the relationship between the square of the orbital period and the cube of the orbital radius in circular motion, and discuss its implications for astronomy.

### Problem 2

Discuss the concept of escape velocities. Define and analyze the first, second, and third cosmic velocities, and their importance in space exploration.

### Problem 3

Analyze the concept of gravitational slingshot (gravity assist). Explain how spacecraft can use the gravity of celestial bodies to change their trajectory and velocity. Discuss its practical applications in interplanetary missions.
