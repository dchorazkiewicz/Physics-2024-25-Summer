## Motion

### Problem 1

A body movement is described by the equation:

$$
\begin{align*}
x(t) &= t+\sin(t) \\
y(t) &= \cos(2t)
\end{align*}
$$

Find the velocity and acceleration of the body. Make a animation of the body movement in Geogebra, Python or JavaScript.

### Problem 2

A body movement is described by the equation:

$$
\begin{align*}
x(t) &= \frac{\sin(t)}{1+t} \\
y(t) &= \frac{\cos(t)}{1+t}\\
z(t) &= \frac{t}{1+t}
\end{align*}
$$

Find the velocity and acceleration of the body. Make a animation of the body movement in Geogebra, Python or JavaScript.

### Problem 3

A body movement is described by the equation:

$$
\begin{align*}
x(t) &= \sin(n t) \\
y(t) &= \cos(m t)
\end{align*}
$$

where $n$ and $m$ are integers.

Find the velocity and acceleration of the body. Make a animation of the body movement in Geogebra, Python or JavaScript.


## Projectile Motion

### Problem 1

A body is thrown with an initial velocity of $v_0$ at an angle $\theta$ with respect to the horizontal. Find the equations of motion of the body. Make a animation of the body movement in Geogebra, Python or JavaScript.
