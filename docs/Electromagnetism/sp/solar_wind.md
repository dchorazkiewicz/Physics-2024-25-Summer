# Simulating the Aurora Borealis Using the Lorentz Force

## Overview

The aurora borealis (northern lights) is a stunning natural phenomenon caused by the interaction of charged particles from the solar wind with Earth's magnetic field. These particles, primarily electrons and protons, spiral along magnetic field lines, collide with atmospheric gases, and emit light. The motion of these particles is governed by the **Lorentz force**, which describes the force exerted on a charged particle moving through electric and magnetic fields.

This task explores the physics behind the aurora by simulating the motion of charged particles in Earth's magnetic field, modeled as a dipole field. By solving the equations of motion for these particles, you will gain insights into the mechanisms responsible for the beautiful displays of light near the poles.

## Key Concepts

1 **Earth’s Magnetic Field:**

   - Approximated as a dipole field, with field lines emerging near the geographic South Pole and re-entering near the North Pole.
   - The magnetic field at a point $(x, y, z)$ can be expressed as:
     $$
     \mathbf{B} = \frac{\mu_0 M}{4\pi r^5} \left( 3(\mathbf{m} \cdot \mathbf{r})\mathbf{r} - r^2\mathbf{m} \right)
     $$
     where:
     - $\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space.
     - $\mathbf{M}$ is the Earth's magnetic moment.
     - $\mathbf{r}$ is the position vector.
     - $\mathbf{m}$ is the unit vector of $\mathbf{M}$.
     - $r = |\mathbf{r}|$ is the distance from the Earth's center.

2 **Lorentz Force:**

   - Describes the force acting on a charged particle in an electromagnetic field:
     $$
     \mathbf{F} = q(\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B})
     $$
     where:
     - $q$ is the particle’s charge.
     - $\mathbf{E}$ is the electric field (assumed negligible in this simulation).
     - $\mathbf{v}$ is the particle’s velocity.
     - $\mathbf{B}$ is the magnetic field.

3 **Equations of Motion:**

   - Using the Lorentz force, the motion of a charged particle is described by:
     $$
     m \frac{d\mathbf{v}}{dt} = q \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}
     $$
   - These equations are numerically integrated to simulate the trajectory of the particle.

## Implementation Outline

1 **Input:**

   - Initial position and velocity of the particle.
   - Particle properties: charge ($q$) and mass ($m$).
   - Magnetic field parameters, modeled as a dipole field.

2 **Process:**

   - Compute the magnetic field at the particle's position using the dipole model.
   - Calculate the Lorentz force acting on the particle.
   - Update the particle's velocity and position using numerical integration (e.g., Runge-Kutta methods).

3 **Output:**

   - A 3D trajectory of the particle, showing how it spirals along Earth's magnetic field lines.
   - Visual representation of the auroral effect by aggregating trajectories of many particles.

4 **Testing Examples:**

   - Simulate a single charged particle injected into Earth's magnetic field at different latitudes.
   - Simulate multiple particles with varying initial velocities and charges.
   - Compare results to known auroral patterns, such as their concentration near the poles.

   - Modeling complex systems like the aurora requires solving coupled differential equations with high accuracy.

3 **Visualization of Natural Phenomena:**

   - By simulating the trajectories of charged particles, we can replicate the conditions that lead to the formation of the aurora borealis.
