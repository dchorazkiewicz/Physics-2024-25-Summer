# Circuit Analysis Using Graph Theory and Kirchhoff's Laws

## Overview

Analyzing electrical circuits is a fundamental task in understanding and designing modern systems. Kirchhoff's laws—Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) and Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL)—provide a systematic approach to determining current and voltage distributions in complex networks. 

Graph theory offers a powerful tool for automating this process by representing circuits as graphs, where:

- **Nodes** correspond to junctions.
- **Edges** represent electrical components (e.g., resistors, capacitors, inductors, or voltage sources).

This approach simplifies the formulation and solution of Kirchhoff's equations, paving the way for efficient analysis of even the most intricate circuits.

## Key Concepts

1 **Graph Representation of Circuits:**

   - Nodes represent junctions in the circuit.
   - Edges are weighted with component values such as resistance, capacitance, or inductance.

2 **Kirchhoff's Laws:**

   - **KCL (Current Conservation):** The sum of currents entering a node equals the sum of currents leaving the node:
     $$ \sum I_\text{in} = \sum I_\text{out} $$
   - **KVL (Voltage Conservation):** The sum of voltage drops in a closed loop equals zero:
     $$ \sum V = 0 $$

3 **Algorithm Steps:**

   - Identify nodes and edges in the circuit graph.
   - Traverse the graph to identify loops and branches.
   - Formulate equations based on KCL and KVL.
   - Solve the resulting system of equations to find unknown currents and voltages.
